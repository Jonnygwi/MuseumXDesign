# MuseumXDesign
## Introduction

### Background

What we are going to do today
 - Get you started on the world's biggest network of coders (GitHub)
 - Launch your own web page live on the internet
 - Make your page unique by playing with code in HTML and CSS languages
 - Enable museum visitors to acess your page when they get to your chosen gallery and object

## Presenting content on the web

**content/format**
 - What do we want people to get out of our project?
 - What kind of content do we need to achieve these things? A compelling title, copy, images etc.

**Wireframes**

**Distribution**
 - Pretend we're back in 1970 or date before the web existed. How might we distribute the content we've sketched out? Stick it to your fridge, that may access a small audience. Pin in to a notice board, local area can access a wider audience. You could all do this, you know what tools you need to achieve this, pens, paper, pins, maybe a printer.
  - Now we have the web, which gives us the potential to access billions of people. The tools you need to get this done are much less obvious and not until recently were taught at school. So, lets start taking a quick look at the tools needed to create a website.

## Anatomy of the web

- Browser
- Server
- HTTP
- HTML
- CSS

Demonstrate how these tools are working together when visiting their school website. Have a good look the at the code using the Chrome Dev Tools.

## Get a page live

- Github
- Demonstrate the Facebook etc. Github repo, show the collaboration and sharing aspects.
- Everyone starts their first repo using the Github Pages automatic generator to get a generic page live. Relate this back to the anatomy i.e. where is the server, what is the starting code.

## Customising code - basics

- Paste generic code into JSBin and edit
- Get all learners to a first, basic level of customisation and commit the changes in the GitHub repository. Note the changes to the public page.

## Free play

30 minutes of free play. Experiment with fonts, images, video embed, colours, elements from different APIs (Facebook, instagram). We can be ambitious - the worst that can happen is I have to go around fixing things. Sometime the best learning happens when you "break" something.

## Linking the digital with the physical
