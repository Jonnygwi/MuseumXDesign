### MuseumXDesign

### A little bit about me

Not a computer scientists, I learnt to code by myself through experimenting and tinkering.
I was recently in your shoes and want to show you that it's easy to get started and anyone can give it a go!

### A little bit about you

Do you have any coding experience?

### Session plan

What we are going to do today
 - Get you started on the world's biggest network of coders
 - Launch your own web page live on the internet
 - Make your page unique by playing with code in HTML and CSS languages
 - Enable museum visitors to access your page when they get to your chosen gallery or object

## Presenting content on the web

**content/format**
 - What do we want people to get out of our project?
  - Do we want to invoke emotion, inform, inspire etc?
 - What kind of content do we need to achieve these things?
  - A compelling title, copy, images etc?

**Wireframes**

**Distribution**
 - Pretend we're back in 1970 or date before the web existed. How might we distribute the content we've sketched out? Stick it to your fridge, that may access a small audience. Pin in to a notice board, local area can access a wider audience. You could all do this, you know what tools you need to achieve this, pens, paper, pins, maybe a printer.
  - Now we have the web, which gives us the potential to access billions of people. The tools you need to get this done are much less obvious and not until recently were taught at school. So, lets start taking a quick look at the tools needed to create a website.

## Anatomy of the web

- Browser
- Server
- HTTP
- HTML
- CSS

Chrome developer tools

## Getting a page live

### Github :octocat:

- Collaboration
- Community
- Sharing
- Hosting

<!-- - Demonstrate the Facebook etc. Github repo, show the collaboration and sharing aspects.
- Everyone starts their first repo using the Github Pages automatic generator to get a generic page live. Relate this back to the anatomy i.e. where is the server, what is the starting code. -->

## Customising code - basics

- JSBin
<!-- - Paste generic code into JSBin and edit -->
- Get all learners to a first, basic level of customisation and commit the changes in the GitHub repository. Note the changes to the public page.

## Free play

30 minutes of free play. Experiment with fonts, images, video embed, colours, elements from different APIs (Facebook, instagram). We can be ambitious - the worst that can happen is I have to go around fixing things. Sometime the best learning happens when you "break" something.
